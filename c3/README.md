# Challenge 2: A Thousand Words
Successfully mine ACM Coin on Gradescope.

## Autograder
The class you write in `main.py` is imported and ran against a series of test cases. You will submit:
- `main.py`: Template code for the `Triton` class that you will implement.
- `mine.c`: ACM Coin miner code. You may attempt to modify the number of blocks mined.

## Constraints
- No console output unless all tests passed
- No Python network access
- Submissions using the word `import` will be rejected
